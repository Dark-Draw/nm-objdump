# Nm - Objdump

Simple implementations of the **nm** and **objdump** commands.
Epitech second year project.

`my_objdump` is equivalent to `objdump -fs`  
`my_nm` is equivalent to `nm`

Note that nm's sort may differ. It's the same as nm 23. If you want to use the same as nm 24, you may use `my_nm --sort=24`.

Some diff may occur, to show them, you can use the two scripts `scripts/nm.sh` and `scripts/objdump/sh`
